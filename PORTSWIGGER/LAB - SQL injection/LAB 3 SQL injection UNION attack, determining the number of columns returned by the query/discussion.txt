Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query

QUESTION:
    This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. The first step of such an attack is to determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query. You will then use this technique in subsequent labs to construct the full attack.

    To solve the lab, determine the number of columns returned by the query by performing an SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing null values. 

=======================================
ANALYSIS:
-GOALS: determine the number of columns with UNION attack

SIMPLE LOGIC UNION:
- SELECT a, b, c FROM table1

-SOLVE: 
1. We don't know, how many columns are displayed on the web. Use ORDER BY [NUMBER] or ORDER BY 1 to count the number of columns displayed. IF when calculating an error occurs then the column number has been skipped.

|  ' ORDER BY 1-- |

|__etc.___________|

2. Use UNION to combine SELECT query with column NULL
3. merge by commenting the query behind it: ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL -- "USE SPCASE FOR GENERAL COMMENT"

FULL LOGIC UNION:
- SELECT a, b, c FROM table1 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL
