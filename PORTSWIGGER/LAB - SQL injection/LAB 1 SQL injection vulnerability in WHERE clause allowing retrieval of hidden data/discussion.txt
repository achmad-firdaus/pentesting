Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

QUESTION:
    This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:

    SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

    To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased. 

=======================================
ANALYSIS:
-GOALS: display details of all products in any category

SIMPLE LOGIC SELECT:
- SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'

-SOLVE: 
1. Break query with single quote: ' 
2. use operator query: OR = displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
3. use query that return true, like this 1=1
4. merge by commenting the query behind it: ' OR 1=1 -- "USE SPCASE FOR GENERAL COMMENT"

FULL LOGIC SELECT:
- SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' OR 1=1 -- "USE SPCASE FOR GENERAL COMMENT"'
